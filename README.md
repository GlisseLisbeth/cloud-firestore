#### What's Cloud Firestore?
Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development

It keeps your data in sync across client apps through realtime listeners and offers offline
support for mobile and web so you can build responsive apps that work regardless of network
latency or Internet connectivity.
